  The disasvanatges of this query are: 1. Limited scalability because multiple joins and sorting can degrade performance as data grows. 2. Sorting on title increase resource usage.
  No pagination or limit means returning full results, which may be excessive for real-world records. 3. Performance reliance on indexes - without proper indexing on film_id, category_id and release_year,
  teh query may trigger costly full table scans and sorting overhead.*/

   The disadvantages of the solution: 1. Static year filter (2015) reduces reusability; needs manual edits for future reporting periods. 2. Ignores role weighting - counts all film appearences equally; lead vs cameo not distinguished.

/* The benefits of the provided solution for task1: 1. Single-path conditional aggregation - count (*) filter (...) computes  all three genre totals in ome scan and one group-by.
  2. Correct dimensional model -  joins film, film_category, category as intended for many-to-many genre mapping. 3. Extensible pattern - easy to add more genres by adding more filtered counts.
  The drawbacks: 1. Fixed genre columns - adding or removing genres requires query edits. 2. Schema dependency - assumes every film has a valid release_year and genre mapping, null years are excluded.
  3. No time window control - aggregation across all years unless filetred, reproducibility may require explicit bounds.*/

   The Disadvantages: 1. Limited time filtering - query counts rental for all time; no date range may lead to results skewed by older data. 2. Rating system assumption - dependent on MPAA ratings; may not generalize to other
   markets. 3. Duplicate group risk - grouping by both title and rating can produce multiple rows per film if data is inconsistent.*/

 Which actors/actresses didn't act for a longer period of time than the others? 
The storesâ€™ marketing team wants to analyze actors' inactivity periods to select those with notable career 
breaks for targeted promotional campaigns, highlighting their comebacks or consistent appearances to engage customers with nostalgic or reliable film stars
The task can be interpreted in various ways, and here are a few options (provide solutions for each one):
V1: gap between the latest release_year and current year per each actor;
V2: gaps between sequential films per each actor.*/

/* The advantages of V1 solution: 1. Simple and readible - one pass, clear (max) aggregation, easy to maintain. 2. Efficient - only one group-by over actors; no window functions needed.
  3. Stable orderng - breaks ties by actor name after sorting by gap.
  The disadvantages: 1. Excludes actors with zero films - uses inner joins; actors who have never acted are not reported. 2. Assumes each film - actor link is unique; duplicate links could inflate work.
  3. Non- deterministic over time - depends on current-date, results change daily, hurting report reproducibility.*/

--V2:

/* The advantages of the solution: 1. Window free - uses correlated subquery(select max(...) where release_year <current) instead of lag(..). 2. Readable staging - CTEs make the logic easy to follow. 
  3. Deduped years - select distinct ...release_year avoids double counting.
  The drawbacks: 1. Excludes actors with zero films. 2. Correlated subquery cost. 3. Duplicates across titles in same year - if an actor has multiple films in one year, the gap for that year is 0; acceptable but woth noting.
  Inner join is used between actor and film_actor, between film_actor and film (retrieves release_year for each linked film)
